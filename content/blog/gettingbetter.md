# Getting Better
Writing this blog while I am about two years into my developer career. Its been quite a ride and I've enjoyed every moment of it. Considering the time I've put into development (at least 8 hours a day, everyday for the past two years) I have seen a steady improvement in my skills. Namely, my Javascript skills have improved considerably. 

## Javascript In General
In Javascript, there was a learning curve for me. Being stuck on an issue and discovering that it was an equality issue (=== is not equal to =) or a missed comma or parenthesis caused me some grief in the early days. However, I think those pains are necessary. You will not know those issues exist untl you go through them. And it is better if you go through them on your own time rather then someone elses. 

And then my design skills have gone up. For example, how I structure my code has vastly improved. I use more modern syntax to setup objects. For example, I use classes instead of object literals. I name things better. I'm beginning to notice that the way I name variables (intuitively) allows me to remember their names going from file to file. I don't have to reference sheets everytime. There is an obvious and clear name for this variable. But that will also only come with time. It is only when you make poor naming decisions that you will realize that there is a better way of doing things.  

## Skipping Steps
You can't. Anything, especially this, needs your focus and undivided attention. You can't skip workouts and expect to get in great shape. Same here, you can't expect to take days off and expect your skills to improve.

## Its OK To Suck
Anything can be improved. This article for example has words/setences that could be put in a better order and moved around to convey the same message a shorter way. Well, your code could be better. It could be less verbose and/or repetitive. However, it takes makig those mistakes to get there. So enjoy the time that you suck at it because the better you get the more that will be expected from you. Therefore, don't think too far ahead, enjoy the moment and don't take yourself too seriously.
