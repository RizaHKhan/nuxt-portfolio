# HTTP Requests

There are many different types of requests you can make in your HTTP request.

`GET` : Used to retrieve information. No information sent.

`POST` : Used to enter information, includes some type of data.

`PUT` : Similar to POST.

`PATCH` : Similar To PUT with some nuanced differences. Say you want to 'update' some information, you would use this.
