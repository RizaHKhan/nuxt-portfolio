# Show Up!

This journey has been difficult to say the least. Probably the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.

Learning to code has been this Everest that I'm slowly able to climb but for the first time in my life, I feel that I'm accomplishing something.

It doesn't feel like a chore, I don't get bored and I don't yawn as much. I honestly don't remember yawning at work like I did in my past jobs.
