# Javascript, My Journey

### How I got started

The thing that really got me to start coding (or let me rephrase that: `take something seriously and actually try to get good at it`), was this simple quote:

**There are two kinds of pains: The pain of discipline or the pain the regret.**

I don't know who it is by and I don't really care to know, but it rang true for me that day and I decided to commit.

And that meant, I had to love it most of the day I hated it. I had to push harder on the days that I didn't feel like pushing at all. The choice I made was probably the most difficult thing I have ever done.

A typical day would look like this:

1. 8:00AM Wake up
2. Go to the basement and start coding
3. 12:00PM Sleep

This is how committed I was to my progress. I got a position at a small ad agency quite quickly. I learnt a TON in that year and decided that indeed this was the career for me. Come hell or high water, I was going to succeed in it. No one will stop me or prevent me from getting ahead now.

But I am also finding that there is a lot to learn, and one person cannot know it all. Therefore, a very very niche environment know is very important. You can ask any rate if you know that thing inside out and backwards and forwards. Mainly because you will save your employer time. You have already made the mistakes and taken the hits on the chin. That means they don't have to go over those hurdles and learn from them.

### Future

I've specifically decided to pursue `web scrapping`. I think that the internet is only going to get better and understanding how to retrieve information, adding it to a database, making it available via a `csv` file, or whatever consumable format will be a great skill to know.

For example, a lot of these giant retailers don't have the best API's to go through their database quickly. The old adage 'time is money' would mean that whoever gets that data faster will be the winner. That is where web scrapping comes in. Now, I hardly know anything about this subject so, I am not going to assume anything.

I am going to start small and practice scrapping harder and harder websites. Put those scripts out on Github and then showcase them to potential employers. Apparently this work is quite lucrative. The better I get at it, the more I can end up charging.
