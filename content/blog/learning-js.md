# Javascript, My Journey

### How I got started

The thing that really got me to start coding (or let me rephrase that: `take something seriously and actually try to get good at it`), was this:

**There are two kinds of pains: The pain of discipline or the pain the regret.**

And that meant, I had to love it most of the day I hated it. I had to push harder on the days that I didn't feel like pushing at all. The choice I made was probably the most difficult thing I have ever done.

### Future
