# Puppeteer JS

A browser that can be controlled by a Javascript script. Write your code in Node JS and utilize its API to perform a wide range of tasks.

Its widely used for (but not limited to):

1. Automation
2. Data Scrapping
3. End-to-End Testing

## Installation

`npm i puppeteer`

`npm i puppeteer-core`

## Usage

There is plenty of code snippets to start you off on their **<a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" target="_blank">Github</a>** page. Here we will go over the environment you would want to start building in.

I really suggest copying those code snippets verbatim and making sure they work on your environment. If they do not, you will need to make adjustments. For example, although I have a Windows machine, I do most of my development in the WSL2 Linux Subset, its basically Linux inside Windows. But, there were issues getting dependencies to work on this system, therefore I switched all of my Pupppeteer work onto Windows. That maybe something you will have to do in order to start working.

## The future

As you go over the code snippets, you will notice that the possibilities are quite extraordinary. You are using a browser (in all the ways a real user can) via a JS script. The ability to automate tedious tasks and retrieve information from websites that don't have their own API's.

## Continuing to Advance with Puppeteer

Put in your reps. Create scripts that do more and more difficult things. Incorporate a database into it. Add the contents you've scrapped to a database (Firebase, MongoDB, and maybe a relational database like Postgress)
