# Leveling Up As A Developer

Step 1: Stop Watching Tutorials
Step 2: Start reading docs

## Tutorial Hell

Obviously, if you know nothing about the subject, it will be helpful to watch a few videos on the subject, however, once you get better and better at it, you need to a) practice and b) start reading the offical docs. Besides, thats what the guy making the tutorial referenced. That person didn't come up with all this stuff by themselves.
