# Webpack

## What is it?

You may be familiar with tools like Gulp which are task runners. While they listen for a event (saving a file) they fire the tasks they are tasked to run. This is SOME of what Webpack can do. It is also significantly less verbose then Gulp, so you achieve a lot more for a lot less code. In this blog, we will build a fairly basic `webpack.config.js` file that will allow us to build simple static site pages.
