# Expert Casting (Wordpress Website)

My first ever contract on Upwork was with this client. They had asked me to rebuild <a href="http://expertcasting.ca/" target="_blank">this</a> website that was not mobile friendly or looked particulary good. I was very apprehensive when I got this contract as I didn't have any experience at the time.

I ended up picking up a Wordpress course on Udemy and that really opened up my eyes on how to build themes in Wordpress. Althought in hindsight, I would have purchased a theme and inputted the information that way, but I wanted to really start off as a developer and thus ended up coding everything myself.

I've learnt a lot about web develoment since, but this site is near and dear to my heart because it really put me on the digital map as a creator and developer.

### Vision
I wanted a minimilist, kind of metallic look to the site, and I think I achieved that with the background image and font color/weight.
