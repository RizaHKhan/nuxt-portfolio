# Scribendi

I was involved with creating all the pages for desktop, tablet and mobile. This included lo-fi wireframes, flow charts, interactive prototypes and graphic design work. The project took roughly 3 months with designs originally made in English and then translated into Chinese.

All the pages were designed with Adobe XD.
